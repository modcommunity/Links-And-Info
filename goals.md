# Our Goals/Features
The Modding Community (TMC) is a community/company with goals to push more spotlight/attention and support within the modding community, especially for gaming. Our primary goal is to introduce as many new people/gamers to the modding community which in return will improve content creation, gaming, careers, talent, and more along with make things generally more enjoyable in gaming as a whole. Additionally, we plan on the following.

* A push/movement for improving modding support and modding/community spotlight in as many games as possible including community server support. Big companies we'll be reaching out to and perhaps presenting stuff like the below to is [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) and [Facepunch](https://facepunch.com/) since they handle a majority of the server browser back-ends (especially [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) with their [Master Server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries)).
* A unique global market (supporting any games including singleplayer such as [GTA V](https://www.gta5-mods.com/) and [Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim)) where people can sell or provide mods (AKA addons/plugins, which are all still "mods"). Anybody that makes open-source software linked with things like [GitHub](https://github.com/) (the most popular open-source platform) perhaps earn additional "credits" or reputation for helping the modding/open-source community. Also integrate compiling source code for things like [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/)/[AMX Mod X](https://www.amxmodx.org/) mods (using their compilers with their permission to compile mod's source code into SMX for example). Also adding validation code checkers would be good on letting the public know if a mod is failing to compile depending on the type of mod.
* A place where people can post guides, tutorials, and tools to make modding easier for newcomers (encouraging the use of [github.com/modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) for open-source tools and using TMC's forums for guides/tutorials).
* A new and improved community server browser @ [browser.moddingcommunity.com](https://browser.moddingcommunity.com/). We can make our own query networking code/back-end and make extensions for [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) (for games such as Counter-Strike: [Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/)/[Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) and [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/)), or [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/) and [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/252490/) that communicates with our back-end (in our case, our own Master Server). The server browser can list 30,000 or more servers within 1 - 3 seconds compared to the [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) [Master Server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries) that displays only 4000 servers in more than a minute (the average [A2S\_INFO response](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries#A2S_INFO) size is 256 bytes, if you times that by 20,000 for 20,000 game servers, it comes to around 5 megabytes of traffic which is nothing with modern network connections and if someone's router can't handle 20K PPS, we can add options to limit). Either way it should be able to load servers much faster than the [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/) [Master Server](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries) that most games use for a server browser like Garry's Mod, Rust, CS:GO, TF2, etc.

With that said, we will be trying to gain as much popularity/visibility as possible from social media along with reaching out to as many content creators, YouTubers/streamers (e.g. Twitch), and game companies supporting the modding community to see if they can draw attention to this community (e.g. [Bethesda Game Studios](https://bethesdagamestudios.com/) since they support modding on [Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim)).

We'll also be using things like Reddit along with as much social media as possible (cross-posting from [reddit.com/r/modcommunity](https://reddit.com/r/modcommunity) to bigger sub-Reddits to improve community/modding support in as many games as possible). With the right marketing/advertising strategies, we can very likely form a large social media presence (hoping for 1 - 3+ million followers per platform if done correctly to encourage game developers to listen to the modding community).

To conclude, while it will be an uphill battle to fight with large gaming companies to add better modding support/tools due to the game's economy financially for example, we are still planning to do everything we can to improve the modding community and introduce new people to modding along with making guides and more! Our main goal is to improve gaming and technology as a whole which we believe can be achieved with better modding support!
