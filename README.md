# Goal
The Modding Community (TMC) is going to be a big project aimed to support the modding community. One thing we will focus a lot on is thinking of ideas on how to improve the modding/community support in as many games as possible (e.g. changes to the server browser for example). This includes support for community servers in games such as Rust, Garry's Mod, Counter-Strike: Source/Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, and many more!
